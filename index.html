			I am an graduate student at UC San Diego majoring in Machine Learning who is passitionate about data science
			and deep learning. I believe that Artificial Intelligence has unlocked our potential to build smarter systems 
			and to solve complex problems in industries ranging from self-driving vehicles to retail.  
			I use this blog to show some of the projects that I worked on and hope you will find them interesting!
