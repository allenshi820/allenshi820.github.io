## Goal
Finding a perfect apartment is really diffcult and the whole process should be more than just browsing through endless listings. To better solve this problem and unleash potential business opportunity, I built a model to predict New York rental listings interst level by using the dataset released by RentHop.

$$\alpha$$

$\sum$

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The interest level is categorized into three classes - high, medium and low. Let's first take a look at the geographic distribution of all the listings' interest level.

As the map shows above, most of the listings with low interest level are centered in Manhattan area whereas the apartments with high and medium interest levels are distributed across the Queens, Brooklyn and Bronx.

The pie chart below shows the distrbution of all the listings according to their interest level.
