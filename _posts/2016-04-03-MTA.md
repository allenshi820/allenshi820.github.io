## Story
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year and is trying to do double duty with the gala both to fill the event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.

The stragtegy is to place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to the gala.

## Goal
The goal is to help WTWY grow attendance and awareness of their upcoming gala and optimize the street team's effort by using New York MTA data.
