## Goal
The goal is to segment the “cheetah” image (shown below in the left) into its two components, cheetah (foreground) and grass (background) by implementing a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. The parameters of the model are estimated using maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori methods.

The image on the left is the image that we are trying to segment and the image on the right is the ground truth.

## Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier

The Naive Bayes classifier adopts the Bayesian decision theory, which is just maximum a posteriori estimation.

i^*(x) = \underset{<constraints>}{\operatorname{<argmax>}}
